```javascript
// Ensure your Tailwind CSS configuration is correct and up-to-date.
// In your `tailwind.config.js`:
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', // Update paths to match your project structure
    './node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js', // Add here any other components that use tailwind
    // add more content as needed
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

// Verify that Tailwind CSS is correctly included in your CSS file (usually `main.css` or a similar file):
/* main.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

// Or, use the correct directives within your framework if you are using any. 

//Check that you don't have any conflicting CSS rules that might override the Tailwind CSS classes. 
//If needed, use !important to override. 
// It's not always the best solution, but it can help to debug the problem 
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4 !important">
  This div should have a red background and change to blue on hover.
